I'm sorry, but there seems to be an issue with the code in the provided function. The variable `list` is being overwritten in every iteration of the loop and the condition `date != list[i+1] and date != list[i-1]` is not well-defined for the first and last elements of the sorted list. 

In any case, the intention of the function is not clear. Could you provide more information on what the function is supposed to do?
