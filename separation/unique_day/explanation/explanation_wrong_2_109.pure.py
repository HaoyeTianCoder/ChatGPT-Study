It looks like there is a syntax error in the code because `count_dates` is a function but it is not being called correctly. It should be `count_dates(date, possible_birthdays)` instead of `count_dates`. 

Ignoring the error, the intention of the function seems to be to check if a specific date occurs only once in the list of possible birthdays, and return True if it does and False otherwise.
