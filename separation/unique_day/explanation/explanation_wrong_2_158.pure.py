It seems like there is an error in the code you provided. In the for loop, the loop variable `date` is used to iterate over `possible_birthdays`, but then inside the loop, `day` is used instead. Can you please clarify which variable is correct and what the intention of the function is so I can provide a correct one-sentence summary?
