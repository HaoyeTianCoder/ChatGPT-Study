It looks like there's a mistake in the code where `counter` is not defined and `i` is being used instead, but assuming the correct variable is being used, the intention of the function is to check if there is exactly one birthday in the `possible_birthdays` list that falls on a specific `day`. If there is one and only one such birthday, return `True`, otherwise return `False`.
