There seems to be a typo in the code. It should be `if i[1]==date` instead of `if i[0]==possible_birthdays[1]`. 

Assuming this typo is corrected, the function appears to count the occurrences of the given date in the list of possible birthdays, and returns True if it appears only once and False otherwise.
