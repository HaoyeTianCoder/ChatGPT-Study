This function checks if a specific day is unique within a list of possible birthdays by iterating through the list and counting the number of occurrences of the day, and returns True if the day occurs only once in the list. Note that this function counts the day as long as it appears at least once in a possible birthday, even if it appears more than once within that birthday.
