The function checks if a given date only appears once within a list of possible birthdays and returns `True` if it does and `False` otherwise. However, the implementation is incorrect as it tries to check if an integer `date` is in the list `possible_birthdays`, which would result in a `TypeError` since the function should check for `date` as a string.
