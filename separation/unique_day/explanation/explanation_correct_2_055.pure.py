This function creates a list of all the second elements (days) from a list of tuples, `possible_birthdays`, where each tuple represents a person's name and their birth date. The `map` function applies the lambda function `lambda x: x[1]` to each element of `possible_birthdays`, which extracts the second element of each tuple (the day) and returns a list of all the days.
