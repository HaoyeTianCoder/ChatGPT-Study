It seems that there's an error in the code. The parameter in the function definition is `date`, but it is referenced as `day` inside the function. Assuming the parameter name is corrected to `day`, the intention of the function is to check if the given `day` occurs only once in the list of `possible_birthdays`, returning `True` if it occurs only once and `False` otherwise.
