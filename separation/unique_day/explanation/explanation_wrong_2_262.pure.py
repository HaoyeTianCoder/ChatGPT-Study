It seems that there is an error in the code, as `possible_birthdays[1:]` will exclude the first element of the `possible_birthdays` list and return a new list with the rest of the elements. Therefore, the function will not behave as expected. Assuming that the intent of the code is to check if the date appears more than once in the list of possible birthdays, a corrected version of the function could be:

```
def unique_day(date, possible_birthdays):
    count = 0
    for bday in possible_birthdays:
        if date == bday[1]:
            count += 1
    if count > 1:
        return False
    else:
        return True
```

The intention of the function is to check if a given `date` appears only once in the list of `possible_birthdays`.
