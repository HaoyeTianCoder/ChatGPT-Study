I cannot explain the intention of the function `unique_day` because there seems to be a syntax error in the code. The `result` variable seems to be assigned a tuple, but in the next line, it is being assigned a list. Also, there is an issue with the `result` tuple's concatenation in the for loop, as the `+` operator cannot be used to concatenate a tuple with a list.
