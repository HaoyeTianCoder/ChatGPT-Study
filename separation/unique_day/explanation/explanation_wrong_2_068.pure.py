It seems like there is a variable name error in this code, since the input parameter is `date` but the variable name used within the function is `day`. Assuming this is a mistake and the input parameter should be `day` instead of `date`, the function checks if a given `day` appears exactly once in the list of `possible_birthdays`, and returns `True` if it does, and `False` otherwise.
