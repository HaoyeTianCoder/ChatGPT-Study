It seems there's an error in the code. The variable `days` is initialized to 0 and then used to compare with `possible_birthdays[i][1]`. The intention may have been to initialize `days` to `date`. Without knowing the intention behind the function, it's difficult to provide a one-sentence summary of its purpose.
