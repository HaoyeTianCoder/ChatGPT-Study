It looks like there is an error in the code, as the function is using a variable `day` which is not defined. It should be `date` instead of `day`. Assuming this is corrected, the intention of the function is to check if a given date occurs only once in a list of possible birthdays, and return `True` if it does, and `False` otherwise.
