It seems like there might be a typo in the code you provided. In the if statement, it is checking if the day is in `birthday[1]`, which seems incorrect. However, assuming it should be `birthday` instead of `birthday[1]`, the intention of the function is to check if there is only one instance of the input `day` in the list `possible_birthdays`. If there is, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.
