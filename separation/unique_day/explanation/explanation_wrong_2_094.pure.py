The intention of the function `unique_day()` is to count the number of occurrences of a given `date` in a list of `possible_birthdays`, and return `True` if the count is 1, and `False` otherwise. However, the implementation of the function is incorrect, because the return statement is inside the for loop, which would cause the function to return on the first iteration without checking the rest of the list.
