There is a syntax error in this code - using `append()` method on a tuple (`b` variable). However, the intention seems to be checking whether there is exactly one occurrence of a given `month` in the list of `possible_birthdays`' months. The function returns `True` if there is only one occurrence, and `None` (implicitly) if there are zero or more than one occurrence.
