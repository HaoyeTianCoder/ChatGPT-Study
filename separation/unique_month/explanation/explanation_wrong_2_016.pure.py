The function checks whether a given month appears only once as the first element of a tuple in a list of possible birthdays, and returns True if it does, False otherwise. This implementation uses the map function to extract the first element of each tuple in the list, and then counts the number of times the given month appears in the resulting iterable using a loop, and returns False if it appears more than once, and True otherwise.
