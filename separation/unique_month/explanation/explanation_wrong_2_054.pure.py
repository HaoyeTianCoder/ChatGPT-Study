The function aims to determine if there is exactly one birthday in the provided month in a list of possible birthdays, by comparing the first element of each date tuple in the list to the given month. However, the code logic seems to be incorrect as it returns True or False based on a conditional statement that is true only if the month is the only one present in the month list of the first elements of all tuples.
