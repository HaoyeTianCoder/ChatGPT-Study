The function checks whether a given month appears only once as the first element of a tuple in a list of possible birthdays, and returns True if it does, False otherwise. This implementation creates a tuple of all the first elements of the tuples in the list of possible birthdays, and then counts the number of times the given month appears in the tuple. If it appears exactly once, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
