It seems like there's a typo in the code -- the variable name is spelled incorrectly. Here's the corrected function with a one-sentence explanation of its intention:

```
# Returns True if the given month is a unique month in the list of possible_birthdays.
def unique_month(month, possible_birthdays):
    counter = 0
    for date in possible_birthdays:
        if date[0] == month:
            counter += 1
    if counter == 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
