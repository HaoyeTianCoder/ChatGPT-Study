It seems like there is an error in the code you provided. The parameter name is `month` but in the function body it is referred as `date`. Assuming that you meant `month` instead of `date`, the intention of the function is to determine if the input month appears only once in the first element of the tuples in `possible_birthdays`. If so, return True, otherwise return False.
