The function checks whether a given month appears only once as the first element of a tuple in a list of possible birthdays, and returns True if it does, False otherwise. This implementation creates a tuple of all the first elements of the tuples in the list of possible birthdays that match the given month, and returns True if the length of the tuple is less than 2, False otherwise.
