The function checks whether a given month appears only once as the first element of a tuple in a list of possible birthdays, and returns True if it does, False otherwise. This implementation removes the first tuple containing the given month from the list of possible birthdays, and then checks whether the month appears in the resulting list. If it does, the function returns False; otherwise, it returns True.
