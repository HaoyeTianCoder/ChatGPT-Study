This function intends to check if a given month occurs only once across a list of possible birthdays. It returns `True` if the month occurs only once and `False` otherwise. 

However, it has a logic error since it checks the month occurrence only in the first element of the `possible_birthdays` list, so it's not a correct implementation.
