The function checks if there is only one unique instance of a specified month within a list of possible birthdays, and returns True if there is only one instance, and False otherwise, by iterating through the list and counting the occurrences of the specified month, and returning False if there is more than one occurrence. Here, the month is checked against the second element of each tuple in the list.
