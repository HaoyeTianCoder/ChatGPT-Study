This function `unique_month` is incomplete and does not provide any implementation. 

The second function `enumerate_tree` takes a `tree` and returns an iterator over the nodes in the tree, with each node represented as a tuple `(value, children)`, where `value` is the value of the node and `children` is a list of child nodes.
