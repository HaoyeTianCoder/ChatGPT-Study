The intention of this function is to check if there is only one occurrence of a given month in a list of possible birthdays. If so, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. However, the current implementation has a logical error where it will return False if there are more than one possible birthday with the given month, instead of continuing the loop to check all the possible birthdays.
