It looks like the `days_in_month` variable is not defined in this function, so it won't run properly. Assuming it's meant to represent the days in the given month, the intention of the function is to check whether there is at least one unique day in that month based on the `possible_birthdays` input. If there is a unique day, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
