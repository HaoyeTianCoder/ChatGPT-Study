The function `contains_unique_day` takes in a month and a list of possible birthdays, then it creates a tuple of all possible birthdays in that month and checks if any of those dates have a unique day (i.e., the day does not occur in any other birthdays in the input list). It returns True if there is at least one such date, otherwise False.
