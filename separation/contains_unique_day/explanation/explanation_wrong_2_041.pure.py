I'm sorry, but without the context of the specific implementation of the `unique_day()` function and the input format of the `possible_birthdays` argument, it's difficult to accurately describe the intention of the `contains_unique_day()` function. 

The `contains_unique_day()` function name suggests that it is checking whether there is at least one unique birthdate within a given month, but the specifics of how it does so would depend on the implementation details of `unique_day()` and the input format of `possible_birthdays`.
