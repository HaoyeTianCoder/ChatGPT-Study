The function `contains_unique_day` intends to take in a month and a list of possible birthdays, create a new tuple containing only the birthdays in the given month, and then check if any of the unique days in that month are duplicated. The function then returns a boolean value of `True` if a unique day exists and is not duplicated, and `False` otherwise.
