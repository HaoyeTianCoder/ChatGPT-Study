It is not possible to determine the intention of the function `contains_unique_day` without additional information or code. 

The function takes two parameters, `month` and `possible_birthdays`, but there is no implementation provided. The function just returns without doing anything. 

The intention of the function would depend on the implementation, which is missing in this case.
