This function aims to determine if there is a unique day for a given month among the possible birthdays provided by iterating over the possible_birthdays list and checking whether the month is the same as the month in the current birthday, and if it is, checking whether there is a unique day for that month by calling the unique_day function with the day of the current birthday and the possible_birthdays list. If a unique day is found, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
