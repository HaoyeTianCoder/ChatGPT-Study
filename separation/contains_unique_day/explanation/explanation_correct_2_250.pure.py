It looks like there is an error in this function as it doesn't return a boolean value in all cases. Specifically, if the outcome tuple is empty (meaning there are no unique birthdays in the month), the function will return False. However, if the outcome tuple is not empty, the function will return the result of calling the `unique_day` function on the second element of the outcome tuple, which may or may not be a boolean value depending on the implementation of `unique_day`.
